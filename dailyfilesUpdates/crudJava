To process HTTP  or  methods in a Java application and interact with a MySQL database, you typically use a web framework like Spring Boot and a persistence library like JPA or Hibernate. [1, 2, 3, 4]  
The process involves several key steps: 
1. Front-end Request 
The front-end sends an HTTP request to a specific endpoint defined on your back-end server. For example: 

•  (to create a new user) 
•  (to remove a user by their ID) [7, 8]  

2. Back-end Controller 
In Java, a controller class handles these incoming HTTP requests using annotations provided by your web framework (e.g., Spring MVC/Spring Boot). 

• : This annotation maps the request to a specific Java method that will process the data sent by the client. 
• : This annotation maps the request used for removing resources. [13, 14, 15, 16]  

3. Service Layer 
The controller passes the data or request to a service layer. This layer contains the business logic and orchestrates the database operations. [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]  
4. Persistence Layer (JPA/Hibernate) 
The service layer interacts with the database via a repository interface. Frameworks like Spring Data JPA automatically generate the necessary SQL queries based on simple method names (like  or ). 

• You configure your application with the JDBC driver details to connect to MySQL (username, password, URL). 
• JPA handles the SQL translation automatically. [27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
