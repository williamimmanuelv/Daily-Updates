Alright — blunt truth.

Your font **is working exactly as coded**.
Your problem is that you **never applied it anywhere**.

You loaded the font → good.
You defined weights → good.
You used it in the page → nowhere.

So the browser falls back to default fonts.

---

## What’s broken (root issues)

### 1️⃣ No global font-family applied

You declared:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'exo_2';
}
```

But you never did:

```css
body {
    font-family: 'exo_2', sans-serif;
}
```

Without that, nothing changes.

---

### 2️⃣ Bootstrap is overriding you

Bootstrap sets fonts globally:

```css
body {
  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, ...
}
```

If your CSS loads **before** Bootstrap or without override strength, Bootstrap wins.

Your CSS is after Bootstrap (good)… but you still didn’t apply the font.

---

### 3️⃣ Your font paths are probably wrong

You wrote:

```css
src: url('fonts/Exo_2/static/Exo2-Regular.ttf')
```

But your CSS file is in root:

```
style.css
fonts/
```

If your structure is:

```
/style.css
/fonts/Exo_2/...
```

Then path is fine.

If instead:

```
/css/style.css
/fonts/Exo_2/...
```

Then path must be:

```css
../fonts/Exo_2/static/Exo2-Regular.ttf
```

If the path is wrong → font silently fails.

Check DevTools → Network → Fonts.

---

## Fix (minimum working solution)

Add this at the **bottom** of your CSS:

```css
body {
    font-family: 'exo_2', sans-serif;
}
```

If you want headings bold:

```css
h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
    font-family: 'exo_2', sans-serif;
    font-weight: 700;
}
```

---

## Cleaner @font-face setup (yours is messy)

You don’t need 3 declarations unless you’re actually using them.

Do this instead:

```css
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Exo2';
    src: url('./fonts/Exo_2/static/Exo2-Regular.ttf') format('truetype');
    font-weight: 400;
}

@font-face {
    font-family: 'Exo2';
    src: url('./fonts/Exo_2/static/Exo2-Bold.ttf') format('truetype');
    font-weight: 700;
}
```

Then apply:

```css
body {
    font-family: 'Exo2', sans-serif;
}
```

---

## Common mistakes you might also be making

Check these before blaming CSS:

* Font files actually exist
* No 404 errors in DevTools
* CSS file linked correctly
* Cache cleared (hard refresh)
* Font name spelled exactly the same

You used:

```
'exo_2'
```

If you apply:

```
font-family: 'Exo2';
```

It won’t work. Names must match.

---

## Quick diagnostic test

Add this temporarily:

```css
body {
    font-family: 'exo_2', sans-serif !important;
}
```

If font changes → Bootstrap override issue solved.

If not → path / loading issue.

## Reality check on your code quality

Since you want brutal feedback:

* Inline styles everywhere → amateur
* Repeated height hardcoding → fragile layout
* SVGs positioned absolute → will break responsive
* No responsive grid fallback → mobile risk
* Font-face overkill → unnecessary weight

Your page “works”… but it’s not production clean.

---

If you want, I’ll:

* Fix font loading properly
* Convert inline styles → CSS classes
* Make cards responsive
* Optimize grid for mobile

Right now you’re building visually…

…but structurally it’s duct tape.
