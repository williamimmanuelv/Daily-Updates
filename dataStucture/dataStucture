to indicate the speed of the data we use big O 

four speed timer
    - n2 O(n2)
    - n O(n)
    - logn O(logn)
    - 1 O(1)

array three operations
    - Insertion
    - deletion
    - searching
    - trarersal

Big O of 1 --> O(1)

Big O means -
    the set of data that we have and while we increase and decrease the data do the time is increaing or  decreasing that's called BIG O

big O(1) --> while increase the data time stays constant
big O(n) --> while increase the data the timing also increases
big O(n2)

O(1) --> constant time
O(n) --> linear time
O(n2) --> quadratic time

01 -->  Big O of 1 --> O(1)
insertion -

    It doesn't depend on number of data you have 

    for example if we a have a data and when we change the data by increasing or decreasing the data and the timing is constant its called BIG O OF 1

    

deletion -

    - we have to search for one thing or one condition only
        do the data have same name and we alter that (increase or decrease) so it doesn't need much time

    - This is also does the same - we already have the data and we find that and delete the data

    - So its speed is BIG O OF 1

02 -->  Big O of n --> O(n)

searching -

    - for searching we need to check two conditions

    let's say we are search which box has highest data count
        - first we'll be starting from first box and we store the data name and data count , then we'll go to next box and compare the count with the previous one and we count the data and same for the next 
        - now we'll be comparing the counting at the same time and we'll be entering all the data for that

    for example - 
        
            if we've 10 data time will take 10 sec but if we've 100 data the time will increase and it'll become 100 sec . Now this is not a constant time and its always changing based on the data and the requirement for the search


    here, time is linear


    check the first box then check the second box then third to find the desired data - this is called linear search 


03 --> Big O of n2 --> O(n2)

    formula --> nx(n-1)/2

        if I hand shake with 2 person how many handshakes are happened three hand but two hand shakes 

        lets go little further 

        - if there is 10 person including me how many hand shakes are there?  10! no

        for that we need to caculate or we need a formula 
            - formula is nx(n-1)/2

            now lets do the math
            
            1x(10-1)
            10 - 1 = 9

            10x(10-1)/2

            100-10
            90/2 = 45

        so,
            if n = 3 (3x(3-1)/2) the answer is 3,
            if n = 5 (5x(5-1)/2) the answer is 10
            if n = 10 (10x(10-1)/2) the answer is 45

        the number increases super fast
            




04 --> Big O of logn --> O(log2)

    log means divided by 2

    explaination -
         Lets say we open a dictionary with a word helicoptor in our mind and we ended up on the middle of the C letter then we won't be turning back to A,B,C we'll be turning the pages in forword.
         So , let's say that means we'll be dividing the actual thing with the 2.

Process of measuring the speed and efficiency are an alogorithm is called time complexity.


Process of measuring the speed of datastructure or  algorithm is called time complexity




    check the first box then check the second box then third to find the desired data - this is called linear search 
    this linear search is called algorithm


Start by learning these types of data structures

    - Array
    - Stacks
    - Queues
    - Linked Lists


Algorithms

    - Linear Search 
    - Binary Search
    - Bubble Sort
    - Selection Sort
